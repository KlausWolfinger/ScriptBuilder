# ScriptBuilder
The Script Builder is a freeware tool for creating text files containing similar content contained in blocks with different values​​. For example, in configuration scripts to enter mass data, etc.

For this purpose, the variable data is loaded by importing a table in the tool. The data fields can then be used as variables in a Text Block template, from which the configuration script should be generated. Script Builder then repeats for each record - meaning each row of the table - the corresponding text blocks and thus generates the whole script.

The data input and the specification of the data blocks is very flexible. Data can also be output in various output files.

The Script Builder was created as a temporary solution, when such a function was required but there was no tool available. Starting as an Excel macro quickly became apparent that the execution was too slow when large amounts of data need to be processed. So development was switched to the programming language C# and the .Net Framework. The tool in its current form is the result of several hours and weeks of work. I completely developed it on my own.

To make it accessible to other people who are facing similar challenges, this website has now emerged. I hope other users can quickly identify a benefit and use it to their own work easier.

### CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROJECT

I'm developing this project with Visual Studio Community 2015. Feel free to help me. You can add a translation in other Languages or help update the code.
This project was created a long time ago. Since that time it was not ment to be developed in a community. My C# skills improved since then but I did not find the time to work over this project, so I decided to load it into GitHub.

THe code is not well commented. If you want to contribute let me know. If you have problems to understand my code just ask and I try to remember and help you.
